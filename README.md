## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
Created an empty repo in GitHub, then `npx create-react-app <folder name>` where you want it to go. Then used:

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
to connect the React app with my GitHub folder
